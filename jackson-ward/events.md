Thousands of people visit historic Jackson Ward to reminisce about the days when 2nd Street was the heart and soul of Richmond's African American community, and was known as “the Harlem of the South.” As always, your family will enjoy the Kidz Zone, popular food vendors, a marketplace and Artists Row to shop, and the Richmond Metropolitan Antique Car Club.
