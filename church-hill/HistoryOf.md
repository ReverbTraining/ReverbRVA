Church Hill is in the Eastern District of Richmond when looking at a map, and gets it's name from St. John's Episcopal Church. This is the site where, during the second revolutionary convention, Patrick Henry famously cried:
>Give me Liberty or Give me Death!



The district encompasses the *original* plot of land that defined Richmond City.
