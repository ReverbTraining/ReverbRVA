# The Hof Garden
_2818 W. Broad Street_
#### A rooftop bar w/ DJ and breakdancers!

Overall, the downstairs pub is comfortable and the staff is eager and friendly to serve up a European lager, ale or even a glass of prosecco along with a U Boat filled with kraut, brats and soft-pretzels. If this was all there was to The Hof, I’d be happy and content here, but so much more is just an elevator ride away.
